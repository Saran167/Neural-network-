This project demonstrates how to train a neural network on the Iris dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to classify these samples into three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
